    <h1>Retro Key Lime Icebox Pie (Recipe Research)</h1>
    <p>Description: Key lime icebox cake is the no-bake dessert of your summer dreams. It features layers of graham crackers and an airy key lime cream that’s stuffed in between. An overnight stint in the fridge softens the crackers, making them more cakey, which helps marry them with the rich, indulgent flavor of key lime pie. And because there’s no need to turn on your oven, this light and tangy key lime icebox cake is perfect for those hot days. </p>

        <h2>Sources</h2>
        <h3>Recipe Website</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/key-lime-icebox-pie-recipe-11757764">AllRecipes.com</a>: This site has a clean, intuitive structure with a clear hierarchy, and its fresh color palette complements the photographed pie. Key details like prep and cook time are foregrounded, and the top-down thumbnails for each step make the tools and food states easy to understand at a glance.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/key-lime-icebox-cake-recipe-23665762">TheKitchn.com</a>: The Kitchn uses an elegant color scheme and serif fonts that match the refined feel of the dessert. While the content could be spaced out more to make scanning easier, the use of bold circular markers on the numbered steps helps draw attention and keeps readers oriented.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes/1416-pan-seared-shrimp-with-garlic-lemon-butter">LouisianaCooking.com</a>: The recipe content is concise and well-organized, reducing any chance of confusion. However, the chosen serif typeface feels visually uneven in weight, which makes longer text passages harder to read comfortably.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Non-recipe website</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.2-c.earth/take-action">2°C Earth</a>： The site uses an accordion component to structure its content hierarchy, allowing users to expand sections progressively. This is complemented by a recurring page-flipping animation motif that reinforces the site’s editorial, magazine-like tone.</li>
            <li><a href="https://savor.it/">Savor</a>: The site uses dynamic scroll-triggered animations, such as text fading in as the user scrolls and arrows guiding attention toward upcoming sections. One standout moment is the image carousel, where visuals appear one by one in a spiral upward motion, creating a sense of narrative flow.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.purposetalent.xyz/">PurposeTalent</a>: The subtle micro-animations applied to graphic elements bring the page to life, while the consistent use of card-based layouts creates clear content partitions. Reusing the card motif across sections also gives the design a cohesive, modular rhythm.</li>

<!-- Over the next few weeks, you will be designing and building a web page that presents a recipe. We'll start that project by finding/choosing a recipe, and doing some design research. This week, you will upload an HTML document that presents the following:

The recipe content (at minimum, this includes title, description, ingredients, instructions, source attribution)
Sample imagery (this may or may not be actual images from your recipe source, it might instead be samples of photos/illustrations representing the type of images you intend to use)
Three links to recipe websites you have found, with a short (2-3 sentences) written review/critique for each, explaining what makes this site a good reference
Three links to non-recipe websites with stylistic or communication techniques that might inform your own design, also with a short written rationale -->

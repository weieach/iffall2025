    <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).
      </li>
      <p>
        Hi my name is Nicole! I'm a Communications Design major junior level
        student, with a HCI minor.
      </p>
      <li>
        Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this
        class.
      </li>
      <p>
        I’ve done a lot of UI/UX design in the past but quickly ran into the
        limits of what I could express without coding. I realized that to
        fine-tune interactions the way I envisioned, I needed to learn front-end
        programming.
      </p>
      <li>
        Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about
        it.
      </li>
      <p>
        Last semester I took CS204, where we covered HTML and CSS in depth
        (flexbox, grids, media queries), JavaScript (DOM editing, API
        integration), and were introduced to React for our final project. I feel
        like I gained a solid foundation, though I’m still not fully comfortable
        with React yet.
      </p>
      <li>Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</li>
      <p>In CS204 we had set project structures more focused upon code-learning, so there wasn’t much room to choose direction or style. In this class, I hope to have more freedom to experiment with front-end techniques and test out different approaches to design.</p>
      <li>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</li>
      <p>Screen design feels fluid and continuous, while paper design is inherently fixed and partitioned. The interactive nature of screens introduces a different kind of flow.</p>
      <li>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</li>
      <a href="https://if-an-a-bomb-falls.tftl.agency/">If a Bomb Falls</a>
      <p>This site about nuclear crisis uses typography and imagery in a striking, cohesive way. The design reflects its historical subject matter while keeping viewers engaged and curious to learn more.</p>
      
      <li>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</li>
      <a href="https://gsap.com/scroll/">GSAP Scroll</a>
      <p>As a JS library site specializing in scrolling animation, it communicates through clear text, animations, and interactive examples. The concise copy and multimodal layout show exactly what the library can do in a way that’s both engaging and effective.</p>
      

      <li>Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</li>
      <a href="https://www.cosmos.so/">Cosmos.so</a>
      <p>As a moodboarding platform, it has a clean interface and intuitive navigation. Its content sorting and browsing experience feel smooth and well thought-out, similar to Pinterest but with its own distinct design polish.</p>

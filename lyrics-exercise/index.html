    <h3>[Verse 1: 2-D]</h3>
    <p>
        Oh, joys arise, the sun has come again to hold you <br>
        Sailin' out the doldrums of the week <br>
        The polyphonic prayer is here, it's all around you <br>
        It's all around you, out here
    </p>
    <h3>[Bridge: 2-D]</h3>
    <p>
        And if the whole world is crashing down (On you) <br>
        Fall through space out of mind with me
    </p>
    <h3>[Verse 2: 2-D]</h3>
    <p>
        Where the emptiness we leave behind on warm air rising <br>
        Blows all the shadows far away (Away-away-away) <br>
        The fallin' of the whole empire is here to hold you <br>
        Rolling out and haunted 'til it sleeps
    </p>
    <h3>[Instrumental Break]</h3>
    <h3>[Chorus: Yukimi Nagano]</h3>
    <p>
        Little memories, marchin' on <br>
        Your little feet, workin' the machine <br>
        Say will it spin, will it soar? <br>
        My little dream, workin' the machine <br>
        Soon, like a wave <br>
        Empires will fall <br>
        And closin' in on you <br>
        They're goin' on
    </p>
    <p>
        Little memories, marchin' on <br>
        Your little feet, workin' the machine <br>
        Say will it spin, will it soar? <br>
        My little dream, workin' the machine <br>
        Soon, like a wave <br>
        Empires will fall <br>
        And closin' in on you <br>
        They're goin' on
